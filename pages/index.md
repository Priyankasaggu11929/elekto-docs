# Welcome to The Elekto Project

The Elekto Project develops Elekto, simple software for secure online elections.

Elekto was created as part of an [LFX](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) internship for the Kubernetes project
by [Manish Sahani](https://github.com/kalkayan), and is now a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) infrastructure project.

*If you have reached here trying to vote in an online election, you are in the wrong place.*

## Features

Elekto was designed to support the following:

- 100% [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) workflow for configuration and election administration
- 100% Oauth-driven workflow for voters (no emails)
- Preference election voting (starting with Condorcet)
- Multiple elections for the same organization
- Responsive web design
- Secret ballot voting

The Elekto project was inspired by the long-running [CIVS project](https://github.com/andrewcmyers/civs).
