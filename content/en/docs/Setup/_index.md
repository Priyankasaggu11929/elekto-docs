Elekto is a DIY service, so in order to start using it, you're going to have to install it:

* [Developer Installation]({{< relref "devinstall.md" >}})
* [Server Installation]({{< relref "installation.md" >}})
* [Kubernetes Installation]({{< relref "kubernetes.md" >}})

And then regardless of how you installed it:

* [Configuration]({{< relref "installation.md" >}})
