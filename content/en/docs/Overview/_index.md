  Overview of Elekto Project.
---

The Elekto Project is a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) accessory project which develops online voting software intended for use by the CNCF itself and by open source cloud native projects.

Originally written for the needs of the Kubernetes and OpenTelemetry projects, the Elekto software is designed to support online preference voting for open source projects.  Based on a GitOps workflow and Condorcet election accounting, Elekto supports your steering committee and TOC elections, committee decision making, and anywhere else a formal project vote is required among a small pool of candidates or options.
